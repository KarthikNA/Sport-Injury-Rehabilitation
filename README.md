Investigating the pain of recreational athletes in sports rehabilitation and the void in the rehabilitation treatment process

RecoveryBook is a daily journal system for injured athletes to track the progress of their rehabilitation process in the form of a mobile application. The application would include a daily checklist of rehabilitation activities such as stretches/exercises to perform, icing sessions, and medicines to take, and the user would receive reminder notifications throughout the day when an activity needed to be completed. The journal would also include a self-assessment/survey to assess the athlete’s pain and feelings about their injury. This information would be used to determine a suggested activity level for the athlete for that day. The application would measure the user’s activity level through pedometer readings and send push notifications to warn the user that their activity level is too high. The user would be able to view their progression history for each day, aided by visuals and graphs, and type out any comments, thoughts, setbacks, and milestones achieved each day.
